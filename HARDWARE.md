Vendor's instructions how to assemble the hardware can be found [here](https://www.udoo.org/docs-x86/Hardware_&_Accessories/Official_Accessories.html). Vendor's metal case is desiged to hold a board without accesories. In order to use this metal case with ethernet daughter board, one needs to cut an opening in the back side. The original drawing can be found [here](http://download.udoo.org/files//UDOO_X86/mechanical_specs/UDOO_X86_metal_case_drawing.pdf). The needed cut out is indicated on UDOO_X86_metal_case_drawing-MODIFIED.pdf.
