# babyIOC
babyIOC is easy to assemble plug and play Debian server with installed latest NSLS2 EPICS Debian distribution, compiled areaDetector package with prosilica sample IOC deployed at /epics/iocs.  NSLS2 Epics Debian distribution is built from community epicsdeb repository and deployed at /usr/lib/epics/ 

## Introduction
Building an EPICS Control System from scratch could be a tedious, time consuming and challenging for the beginners.
We offer you an out of the box solution, when you buy and assemble Single Board Computer, load  precreated image onto microSD card, boot the discless babyIOC computer from this microSD card and build your EPICS iocs using prebuild libraries and packages. If community finds this useful, we can add more sample iocs to ease the learning curve, NSLS2 DAMA bluesky suit, etc.
 
 ## Hardware and parts
The selected hardware is [UDOO x86 board](https://shop.udoo.org/x86/udoo-x86-ultra.html), which can be enhanced with different daughter cards. In this project we use ethernet daughter card, which adds 2 additional interfaces useful in any controls environment.  Though the hardware can be purchased from many distributors, we advise buying directly from [UDOO](https://shop.udoo.org/). They ship fast.
